# Where you can find the original repo

Note: You can use the html file in the Public folder to see the website, but if you change any of the files, you need to use command line tool [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) which will update the files in the Public folder "Command: ```hugo serve```". Hugo is actually a webserver, and when running, it updates the files in the Public folder everytime you make a change to other files.
